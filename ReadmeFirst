Hi, 

This is my project, respecting the constraint of te 3 hours time. 
I'm somewhat happy with what I achieved but there's a few issues that should be solved for it to be a properly presented projected.

The main bug is on the images, if you scroll quite quickly it will be obvious that the images 
flicker as I didn't do a proper assyncronous loading system for them, 
this could be easily solved either by using Kingfisher (I added cocoapods to the project) or 
just by having a cell identification system that would take care of seeing which cell would the image belong to and 
only change it if appropriate.

Besides that there was no time to add local storage, so I quickly hacked a way of storing images in memory with a image caching system, 
but this will cause the app to use way too much ram.

With a couple more hours the project would be way more presentable.

My priority was just having something that worked and could be testable, 
hence I did apply a sort of MVVM-ish structure taht would allow to test easily.

This is my attempt and I tried not to pass the time limit as I thought that I could be "cheating" in doing so. 

Any feedback is appreciated.

Cheers
Fl√°vio.
