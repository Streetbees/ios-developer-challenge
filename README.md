# Streetbees iOS developer challenge 

### Description
Using the best API available on this side of the universe [https://developer.marvel.com/](https://developer.marvel.com/) make a simple master detail app that allows the user to scroll through all the comics ever released and view details for each comic.

You will need to sign up for a free developer account with Marvel.

### Functional requirements (Using the Job to be Done framework)

- When I open the application I want to see a list of all Marvel’s released comic books
- When tapping on a comic it should open up a modal view controller showing the cover art full screen

Feel free to use whatever flare you can to show off your skills.

Don't spend more than 3 hours working on this. Don't worry if you don't get the task finished as we'd like to hear how you prioritised your time.
